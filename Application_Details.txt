=========================================================================================

Phase 1:
--------

Started:29/03/2024
Completed:

Backend:
- Create an apollo server using nodejs/expressjs
- Create Graphql Schema
	- Use Code First Approach
	- Pass the Schema to ApolloServer instead of typedefs and resolvers
- Create Models using sequelize-cli
	- cts_user model
	- cts_user_type model
- Using the sequelize models, create tables in the database
- Add the data into the tables
- Create Graphql queries, mutations, types and resolvers for the tables

Frontend:
- Create Login and Signup Pages
- Add complete functionality for signing up the user and logging it into the App
- Create a Home page with basic structure and with minimal data i.e. Profile of the User


Database:
- cts_user table
	- user_id primary-key string
	- first_name string
	- last_name string
	- email string
	- password string
	- role_id string
	- created_dt date
	- created_by string
	- deleted_dt date
	- deleted_by string

- cts_user_type table
	- type_id primary-key string
	- type_name string

- cts_user_role
	- role_id primary-key string
	- role_name string
	- role_level string
	- type_id string

- cts_project table
	- project_id primary key string unique not null
	- release not null
	- title not null
	- description 
	- status - active, inactive
	- progress - not started, started, blocked, completed, archived
	- project_manager (user_id)
	- project_lead (user_id)
	- start_date dateonly
	- end_date dateonly
	- created_dt date not null
	- created_by string not null
	- deleted_dt date 
	- deleted_by string

- cts_assignment table
	- assignment_id primary key int auto increment
	- user_id not null
	- project_id not null
	- assigned_dt
	- assigned_by (user_id)
	- removed_dt
	- removed_by (user_id)

- cts_task table
	- task_id primary key string unique not null
	- title not null
	- description
	- status [active, inactive]
	- progress [not started, started, in review, blocked, completed, archived]
	- priority [severe, high, medium, low] not null
	- story_points [1-5 based om the time required] not null
	- start_date dateonly
	- end_date dateonly
	- user_id 
	- project_id 
	- assigned_dt
	- assigned_by (user_id)
	- removed_dt
	- removed_by (user_id)
	- created_dt date not null
	- created_by string not null
	- deleted_dt date
	- deleted_by string



cts_user belongsToMany cts_project through cts_assignment
cts_project belongsToMany cts_user through cts_assignment
cts_user hasMany cts_task
cts_project hasMany cts_task
cts_user hasMany cts_assignment (to fetch the cts_assignment compelete details)
cts_project hasMany cts_assignment (to fetch the cts_assignment compelete details)


User_Types for User_Roles:
- Admin - Administrator
- Leadership - Project Manager, Project Lead
- Standard - Designer, Developer, Tester, Validator, Support


Roles: Administrator, Project Manager, Project Lead, Designer, Developer, Tester, Validator, Support


Extra Data needs to be add
- cts_user - skills, 
- Need to create a new table for the skills with categories
- cts_project - design_deadline, development_deadline, testing_deadline, go_live_dt


Process of Communication between Client and Server:
- User will login via email and password
- Server will send a valid token
- By using that token the user will fetch the user data
- Server will send the User data by checking if the token is valid



UI:
Sections in Home Page:
- Menu Section
- Main Section

Types of Projects and Tasks:
- All Projects
- Active Projects
- Completed Projects
